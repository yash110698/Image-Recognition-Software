# Image-Recognition-Software

## Introduction
In a few short years deep learning has completely transformed computer vision. Today computer vision technology is on the most promising areas of research within AI and computer science.

But in a widely discussed 2019 study, a group of researchers led by Emma Strubell estimated that training a single deep learning model can generate up to 626,155 pounds of CO2 emissionsâ€”roughly equal to the total lifetime carbon footprint of five cars.

This project is supposed to test if a competent computer vision software can be achieved without using deep learning techniques.

The Software uses Voila-Jones object detection framework provided by OpenCV library and Hough transform methods to perform object and shape detection on input Images.
